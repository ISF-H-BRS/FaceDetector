After cloning MediaPipe from git, create a subfolder (e.g. 'IFD') inside the root directory and
copy or symlink the files BUILD, mediapipebackendimpl.cpp and mediapipebackendimpl.h along with
the library header ifd.h to that folder.

To build with GPU support (only works on Linux) run
bazel build --compilation_mode opt --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_OPENCV=1 mediapipe

Otherwise run
bazel build --compilation_mode opt --define MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=1 mediapipe

After the compilation is complete, the library should be located in bazel-bin/IFD.

The directory 'mediapipe' containing the model file face_detection_full_range_sparse.tflite
must be copied to the working directory of the application.
